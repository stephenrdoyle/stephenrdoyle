Felicity (Flic) Anderson is a Research Assistant in the Wallace lab. She will be applying the open-source [“RiboViz”](https://riboviz.org/) bioinformatics pipeline to analyze ribosome profiling data, measure protein synthesis and vizualise the output. Flic is also part of the develpment team for the [RiboViz](https://github.com/riboviz/RiboViz) codebase, using Bash, Python and R programming to help improve sustainability and usability of the software, add new features and squash bugs.

Flic will also be assisting with and delivering [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) workshops to boost programming and best-practices software building skills amongst researchers.  She will also be helping deliver schools outreach workshops as part of the [4273 pi](https://www.4273pi.org/) project, bringing practical computing and bioinformatics exercises into the biology curriculum around Scotland.

Flic built her bioinformatics experience in her previous role with the Centre for Middle Eastern Plants (CMEP), part of Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh (RBGE), using R and SQL to help answer biodiversity questions.

Flic is funded on a BBSRC-NSF grant.
