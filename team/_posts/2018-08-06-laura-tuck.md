Dr. Laura Tuck is a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Wallace lab. She completed her PhD in 2018 at the Univeristy of Edinburgh, on the structure and biochemistry of bacterial microcompartment proteins, working with [Jon Marles-Wright](http://www.marles-wright-lab.org/). Laura's current project is building a _Cryptococcus neoformans_ cloning toolkit and using this to study a conserved family of transmembrane proteins that are important for cell growth.

Laura is currently funded by the Wellcome Trust. Her work in the lab was previously funded by the [Wellcome Trust's ISSF3 award](https://www.ed.ac.uk/medicine-vet-medicine/research-support-development-commercialisation/issf).
