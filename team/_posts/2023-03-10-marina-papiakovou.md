Marina is a PhD student on the [Harding Distinguished Scholars Postgraduate Scholars Programme] at the University of Cambridge with Cinzia Cantacessi and is co-supervised by Steve. 

Marina's PhD thesis is focused on the discovery and validation of biomarkers and infection signatures to facilitate early diagnosis of human-infective soil-transmitted helminths in stool & profile disease framework based on microbiome changes, for a better understanding of host-parasite interactions.

Marina has broad experience in working on NTDs and molecular diagnostics, and is developing bioinformatics skills with the support of the Doyle group to assess global variation in mixed STH infections, and determine the impact that genetic variation has on current molecular diagnostic tools.
