Javi spent the final stages of his MSc Bioinformatics and Genetic Epidemiology course (run from Cardiff University) doing a 3 months project 
with me over the 2021 UK summer. 

Javi worked on the project "Understanding the population genomics of the dog heartworm, *Dirofilaria immitis*", which made use of a number of different 
publicly-available genomic datasets to ask questions about the genetic relatedness and population structure among globally-distributed parasite isolates 
in the context of anthelmintic resistance. 

Although he was working remotely, he did a great job, picking up the informatics quickly and putting together a solid thesis. 

Javi has moved back to his "day job" at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal, Spain), Spain, where he works on soil-transmitted helminths with the 
[STOP Consortium].
