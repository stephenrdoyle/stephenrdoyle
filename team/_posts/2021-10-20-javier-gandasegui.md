Javier spent the final stages of his MSc Bioinformatics and Genetic Epidemiology (a course run from Cardiff University) course doing a 3 months project with me over the UK 2021 summer.. 
Javi worked on the project "Understanding the population genomics of the dog heartworm, *Dirofilaria immitis*", which made use of a number of different publicly-available genomic datasets
to ask questions about genetic relatedness and population structure among parasite isolates in the context of anthelmintic resistance. Althoguh he was working remotely, he did a great job, picking
up the informatics quickly and putting together a solid thesis. 

Javi has moved back to his "day job" at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal, Spain), Spain, where he works on soil-transmitted helminths with the 
[STOP Consortium].
