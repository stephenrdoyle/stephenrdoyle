Stephen is a UKRI Future Leaders Fellow (Group Leader) in the Parasites and Microbes Programme at the [Wellcome Sanger Institute]. His Fellowship, which started in 
September 2020, is supported by the [UKRI] and [The Wellcome Trust].

Prior to this, Stephen was a Senior Postdoctoral Fellow from 2015-2020 in the Parasite Genomics group led by Matt Berriman at the Sanger Institute. During this time, 
Stephen focused on developing genetic resources to understand anthelmintic resistance in two economically important pathogens of small ruminants, *Haemonchus contortus* 
and *Teladorsagia circumcincta*. This work led to the assembly of a chromosome-scale genome for *H. contortus* and identification of QTL and causal loci for benzimidazole, 
levamisole and ivermectin resistance.

Stephen's first postdoctoral postion was in the Nematode Functional Genomics group led by [Warwick Grant] at [La Trobe University] in Melbourne, Australia. Here, Stephen 
focused on the genetic analysis of sub-optimal responses by *Onchocerca volvulus* to ivermectin. This work led to the first genome-wide comparative analysis between "good"
and "poor" responders in Ghana and Cameroon, revealing multiple but distinct genetic signations of selection differentiating response types.

Stephen received his PhD in Genetics at La Trobe University in 2011.
