# Abstract 

The RNase II family of 3′-5′ exoribonucleases are present in all domains of life, and eukaryotic family members Dis3 and Dis3L2 play essential roles in RNA degradation. Ascomycete yeasts contain both Dis3 and inactive RNase II-like “pseudonucleases”. The latter function as RNA-binding proteins that affect cell growth, cytokinesis, and fungal pathogenicity. However, the evolutionary origins of these pseudonucleases are unknown: what sequence of events led to their novel function, and when did these events occur? Here, we show how RNase II pseudonuclease homologs, including *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* Ssd1, are descended from active Dis3L2 enzymes. During fungal evolution, active site mutations in Dis3L2 homologs have arisen at least four times, in some cases following gene duplication. In contrast, N-terminal cold-shock domains and regulatory features are conserved across diverse dikarya and mucoromycota, suggesting that the non-nuclease function requires these regions. In the basidiomycete pathogenic yeast *Cryptococcus neoformans*, the single Ssd1/Dis3L2 homolog is required for cytokinesis from polyploid “titan” growth stages. This phenotype of C. neoformans Ssd1/Dis3L2 deletion is consistent with those of inactive fungal pseudonucleases, yet the protein retains an active site sequence signature. We propose that a nuclease-independent function for Dis3L2 arose in an ancestral hyphae-forming fungus. This second function has been conserved across hundreds of millions of years, while the RNase activity was lost repeatedly in independent lineages.
