# Abstract 

Anthelmintic resistance is a significant threat to livestock production systems worldwide and is emerging as an important issue in companion animal parasite management. It is also an emerging concern for the control of human soil-transmitted helminths and filaria. An important aspect of managing anthelmintic resistance is the ability to utilise diagnostic tests to detect its emergence at an early stage. In host-parasite systems where resistance is already widespread, diagnostics have a potentially important role in determining those drugs that remain the most effective. The development of molecular diagnostics for anthelmintic resistance is one focus of the Consortium for Anthelmintic Resistance and Susceptibility (CARS) group. The present paper reflects discussions of this issue that occurred at the most recent meeting of the group in Wisconsin, USA, in July 2019. We compare molecular resistance diagnostics with in vivo and in vitro phenotypic methods, and highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each. We assess whether our knowledge on the identity of molecular markers for resistance towards the different drug classes is sufficient to provide some expectation that molecular tests for field use may be available in the short-to-medium term. We describe some practical aspects of such tests and how our current capabilities compare to the requirements of an ‘ideal’ test. Finally, we describe examples of drug class/parasite species interactions that provide the best opportunity for commercial use of molecular tests in the near future. We argue that while such prototype tests may not satisfy the requirements of an ‘ideal’ test, their potential to provide significant advances over currently-used phenotypic methods warrants their development as field diagnostics.
