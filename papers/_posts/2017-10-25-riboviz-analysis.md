# Summary 

Background: Using high-throughput sequencing to monitor translation in vivo, ribosome profiling can provide
critical insights into the dynamics and regulation of protein synthesis in a cell. Since its introduction in 2009, this
technique has played a key role in driving biological discovery, and yet it requires a rigorous computational toolkit for
widespread adoption.

Description: We have developed a database and a browser-based visualization tool, riboviz, that enables
exploration and analysis of riboseq datasets. In implementation, riboviz consists of a comprehensive and flexible
computational pipeline that allows the user to analyze private, unpublished datasets, along with a web application for
comparison with published yeast datasets. Source code and detailed documentation are freely available from https://
github.com/shahpr/RiboViz. The web-application is live at www.riboviz.org.

Conclusions: riboviz provides a comprehensive database and analysis and visualization tool to enable comparative
analyses of ribosome-profiling datasets. This toolkit will enable both the community of systems biologists who study
genome-wide ribosome profiling data and also research groups focused on individual genes to identify patterns of
transcriptional and translational regulation across different organisms and conditions.
