# Abstract 

A ‘sibling’ species of the model organism *Caenorhabditis elegans* has long been sought for use in comparative analyses that would enable deep evolutionary interpretations of biological phenomena. Here, we describe the first sibling species of *C. elegans, C. inopinata* n. sp., isolated from fig syconia in Okinawa, Japan. We investigate the morphology, developmental processes and behaviour of *C. inopinata*, which differ significantly from those of *C. elegans*. The 123-Mb *C. inopinata* genome was sequenced and assembled into six nuclear chromosomes, allowing delineation of *Caenorhabditis* genome evolution and revealing unique characteristics, such as highly expanded transposable elements that might have contributed to the genome evolution of *C. inopinata*. In addition, *C. inopinata* exhibits massive gene losses in chemoreceptor gene families, which could be correlated with its limited habitat area. We have developed genetic and molecular techniques for *C. inopinata*; thus *C. inopinata* provides an exciting new platform for comparative evolutionary studies.

# Data Availability

All sequence data from the *C. elegans* sibling genome project have been deposited at DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under BioProject accession PRJDB5687. Taxonomic descriptions were deposited at Zoobank. Nematode specimen and strains are available from T. Kikuchi or N. Kanzaki on request. All relevant data are available from the corresponding authors upon reasonable request.
