# Abstract

Rapid advancement in high-throughput sequencing and analytical approaches has seen a steady increase in the generation of genomic resources for helminth parasites. Now, helminth genomes and their annotations are a cornerstone of numerous efforts to compare genetic and transcriptomic variation, from single cells to populations of globally distributed parasites, to genome modifications to understand gene function. Our understanding of helminths is increasingly reliant on these genomic resources, which are primarily static once published and vary widely in quality and completeness between species. This article seeks to highlight the cause and effect of this variation and argues for the continued improvement of these genomic resources – even after their publication – which is necessary to provide a more accurate and complete understanding of the biology of these important pathogens.
