**We study the genetic diversty of helminths of human and veterinary importance. Our research uses population-wide to single-cell resolution genomics approaches to understand the genetic basis for the evolutionary success and future potential of parasitic worms, and identify evolutionary constraints that may be exploited to develop novel ways to control them.**
