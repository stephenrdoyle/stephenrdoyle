**We study how organisms respond to their environment, focusing on molecular mechanisms used by fungi. We collect and analyze genome-scale datasets to understand how fungi dynamically reorganize their RNA and protein to adapt to environmental change. This includes how fungi adapt to infect human hosts.**


Disambiguation: *This is the [Edward Wallace](/team/edward-wallace) Lab studying RNA and Systems Biology in Fungi. It is not to be confused with [the Stephen Wallace Lab studying Chemical and Synthetic Biology](http://wallacelab.bio.ed.ac.uk/), also in Edinburgh.*
