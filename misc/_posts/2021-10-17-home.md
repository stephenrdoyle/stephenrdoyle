**We study the genetic diversty of helminths of human and veterinary importance. We generate and analyse population-wide to single-cell resolution genomic datasets to understand the genetic basis for the evolutionary success and future potential of parasitic worms, and to identify evolutionary constraints that may be exploited to control them.**
