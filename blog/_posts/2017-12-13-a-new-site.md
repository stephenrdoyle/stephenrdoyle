It's an exciting time, with the award of a Wellcome Trust/Royal Society [Sir Henry Dale Fellowship](https://wellcome.ac.uk/what-we-do/directories/sir-henry-dale-fellowships-people-funded) supporting five years of science in a **new lab!!**

The lab website is up and running. This is a big step for a new lab, a new public face!

## Open

The site is fully open source, available in a [GitHub repository][1]. 

The site was inspired by, and adapted from, that of my postdoc mentor [D. Allan Drummond](http://drummondlab.org). This in turn was built from a design from [Trevor Bedford]( http://bedford.io/team/trevor-bedford/).
