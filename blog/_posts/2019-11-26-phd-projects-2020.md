*Update: these deadlines are now passed. Self-funded PhD students are still welcome to contact me following the guidelines below.*

We are advertising PhD projects for 2020 entry, on different aspects of how fungi sense and respond to environmental change. They will all provide training in experimental and computational biology, in a world-class research environment. Each project is with a different fantastic collaborator, and the projects have different emphases.


# RNA, RNA interference, and growth

These projects on *Cryptococcus neoformans* are based in Edinburgh, in collaboration with [Dr. Elizabeth Bayne](http://bayne.bio.ed.ac.uk/).

* [Rest and reactivation in a major fungal pathogen: quantitative analysis of gene regulation in growth-state transitions](https://www.wcb.ed.ac.uk/wcb2/sites/sbsweb2.bio.ed.ac.uk.wcb2/files/common/iCMPhD/Bayne_Wallace_iCMproject2019.pdf), a quantitative project advertised through the [Wellcome Four Year PhD Programme in Integrative Cell Mechanisms](https://www.wcb.ed.ac.uk/iCMPhD). 
* [Mechanisms and functions of RNA interference in Cryptococcus neoformans](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/eastbio-mechanisms-and-functions-of-rna-interference-in-cryptococcus-neoformans/?p113431). This project would be primarily based in the Bayne laboratory.


# How fungi respond to antifungal drugs (antimicrobial resistance)

This project is primarily based in the laboratory of [Dr. Delma Childers](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/people/delma.childers) at the University of Aberdeen.

* [Temporal Adaptation to Antifungal Treatment in Pathogenic Fungi](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/eastbio-temporal-adaptation-to-antifungal-treatment-in-pathogenic-fungi/?p114001).


# Environmental sensing at the cell surface

This project is a collaboration with [Dr. Joanne Thompson](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/joanne-thompson) and [Dr. Jelena Baranovic](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/jelena-baranovic), at the University of Edinburgh. It's the most biochemical project we have listed, focused on function and structure cell surface receptor proteins, and would be primarily based in the Baranovic laboratory.

* [Molecular basis of environmental sensing in fungi and protozoan parasites](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/eastbio-molecular-basis-of-environmental-sensing-in-fungi-and-protozoan-parasites/?p113534)


# Alternative proteins made by alternative translation

This project follows up on recent exciting work in the lab that [you can read on biorXiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/654046v2). It would start a new collaboration with [Prof. Achim Schnaufer](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/achim-schnaufer), at Edinburgh. 
The project would be particularly suitable for a self-funded / Darwin Trust / Carnegie Trust student. 

* [What drives protein production and localization in a major fungal pathogen?](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/what-drives-protein-production-and-localization-in-a-major-fungal-pathogen/?p113548)



# How to apply

To apply, first email [Edward Wallace](/team/edward-wallace) for more information! [Describe your interest in a specific project in specific terms](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/postgraduate/apply/contacting-supervisors). The ideal email would say why you are interested in the subject matter (i.e. some combination of fungi, pathogens, stress or environmental sensing, RNA, and sequencing/synthetic biology/computational biology methods), and also briefly describe your experimental and computational skills. 

Application deadlines for admission and funding are due in **December 2019 and January 2020**, for October 2020 entry, please read the individual links for each project. Different funding opportunities are available for UK, EU and overseas students, for example through the [BBSRC/EASTBIO](http://www.eastscotbiodtp.ac.uk/) doctoral training program or the Darwin Trust of Edinburgh. Ask us about the science first, and if the science is a good fit then we can talk about funding.
