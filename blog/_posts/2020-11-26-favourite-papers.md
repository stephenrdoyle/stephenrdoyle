This blogpost has been created as part of a lab workshop on using [git version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) and has been a great excuse to share and discuss interesting papers that have influenced our work!

### High Throughput Genetics and Cell Biology

*Marah Jnied:*

["A Network of Cytosolic Factors Targets SRP-Independent Proteins to the Endoplasmic Reticulum"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867413001517) is a paper that highlights the importance and complexity of SRP-independent translocation. In this paper, Ast, Schuldiner, et al., employ a combination of hydropathy-based analysis and microscopy to identify a determinant for Endoplasmic Reticulum targeting, and to reveal a network of cytosolic proteins that facilitate SRP-independent targeting and translocation. This paper inspired an exciting set of experiments for my PhD project concerning the RNA binding protein Ssd1.

### Bioinformatics Papers

*Flic Anderson:*

["Best Practices for Scientific Computing"](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745) pulls together ideas for how to produce readable, shareable code that will deliver reliable results worth publishing. It's informed by the authors' involvement in the [Carpentries Organisation](https://carpentries.org/) and it's inspired me to train as a Carpentries Instructor to help teach [data and software workshops](https://edcarp.github.io/) as well as using the skills day to day in my developer work on [riboviz](https://github.com/riboviz/riboviz).


### Functional Genomics Papers

*Edward Wallace:*

["Defining the essential function of yeast Hsf1 reveals a compact transcriptional program for maintaining eukaryotic proteostasis"](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.molcel.2016.05.014) is a neat paper that takes a hard problem and makes it seem easy. Since the 1980s, it was known that **Heat shock factor 1** is an essential gene required for transcription of heat shock protein genes. But it wasn't known why it was essential - which regulatory targets of Hsf1 are actually relied on by the cell? My then-officemate Eric Solís started working on this, and I had little idea what he was so excited about at the start. His work grew into this elegant story that uses genetics, ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, etc, to dissect Hsf1's function away from everything else going on. This paper is a great model of how to take a "pleiotropic" regulatory factor and find out its specific regulatory functions.

Some of my lovely Chicago colleagues wrote a perspective on this work - ["Heat Shock Factor 1: From Fire Chief to Crowd-Control Specialist"](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2016.06.026).

*Eszter Denes:*

["Candida glabrata Drug:H+ Antiporter CgQdr2 Confers Imidazole Drug Resistance, Being Activated by Transcription Factor CgPdr1"](https://aac.asm.org/content/57/7/3159) describes many experiments that can be conducted in order to show that a particular gene causes antifungal resistance in fungi. What is more, the authors also tested which transcription factor controls this gene’s expression levels.
As my PhD project is about antifungal adaptation, I find this paper very informative and inspiring.


### Translational Control Papers

*Rosey Bayne:*

["Translation factor mRNA granules direct protein synthetic capacity to regions of polarized growth"](https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201704019) is a paper from Mark Ashe’s Lab which shows that, in contrast to P-bodies and stress granules, a subset of RNP granules harbour translated mRNAs under active growth conditions and that these granules are inherited by developing daughter cells, where protein synthesis is most heavily required. I work on Ssd1, an RNA binding protein which translationally represses the cell wall-associated mRNAs it binds, until it is phosphorylated by Cbk1 kinase at or near the bud neck where it is under tight cell-cycle control. This paper suggests that once the Ssd1-associated mRNAs are released from repression they should have access to such translation factories and allow expansion of the bud.
