Edward wrote an article about the life events that collided with opening the Wallace lab, here [Scientist and Parent: The bereaved parent](https://elifesciences.org/articles/49932).

It was kindly published by eLife in their wonderful [Scientist and Parent Collection](https://elifesciences.org/collections/29e48019/scientist-and-parent), describing what it's like to combine science and family life. We hope that this article, like others in the collection, might help scientists who are going through their own losses, or looking to support their colleagues having a tough time.
