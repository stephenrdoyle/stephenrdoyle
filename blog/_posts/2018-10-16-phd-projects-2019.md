*Archive post* - We are advertising PhD projects for 2019 entry, on different aspects of how fungi dynamically reorganize their RNA and protein to adapt to environmental change. They will all provide training in experimental and computational biology. They differ in their emphasis on gene expression in response to environmental signals, on RNA-protein interactions, (**newly posted**) on massively parallel interrogation of RNA regulatory sequences, or on fungal pathogenesis. Each with a different and fantastic 2nd supervisor.

## Projects for students from anywhere in the world, including the UK

These projects are based in Edinburgh:

* [How fungi navigate their environment: what drives gene expression patterns in new lab infection models of a major fungal pathogen?](https://www.findaphd.com/search/ProjectDetails.aspx?PJID=101105), with [Dr. Elizabeth Ballou]().
* [How fungi manage stress: the role of RNA binding proteins in post-transcriptional adaptations to heat shock](https://www.findaphd.com/search/ProjectDetails.aspx?PJID=101106), with [Dr. Atlanta Cook](http://cook.bio.ed.ac.uk/).


## Projects for UK/EU students

This project is collaborative with [Dr. Vicent Pelechano](http://pelechanolab.com/) at the  at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, and would involve substantial time in Stockholm. It's part of the [Precision Medicine Doctoral Training Program](https://www.ed.ac.uk/usher/precision-medicine/), funded bythe Medical Research Council, University of Edinburgh and University of Glasgow. Please note that *both* fees and stipend would be covered for EU as well as UK students.
 
* [A massive attack on how messenger RNA sequence specifies condition-dependent RNA fate](https://www.ed.ac.uk/usher/precision-medicine/project-opportunities/19-20-projects/a-massive-attack-on-how-messenger-rna-sequence-spe)

The next project is collaborative with [Prof. Alistair Brown](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/ims/profiles/al.brown) at the [MRC Centre for Medical Mycology](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/cmm/) at the University of Aberdeen, as part of the BBSRC/[EASTBIO](http://www.eastscotbiodtp.ac.uk/) doctoral training program, and would be primarily based in Aberdeen:

* [How do RNA-binding proteins regulate fungal cell walls and environmental adaptation?](https://www.findaphd.com/search/ProjectDetails.aspx?PJID=101173)


## How to apply

To apply, first email [Edward Wallace](/team/edward-wallace) for more information! [Describe your interest in the project in specific terms](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/postgraduate/apply/contacting-supervisors). The ideal email would say why you are interested in the subject matter (i.e. some combination of fungi, pathogens, stress adaptation, RNA, and sequencing/synthetic biology/computational biology methods), and also briefly describe your experimental and computational skills. 

Application deadlines for funding are due in **December 2018** (or 7 January 2019 for the precision medicine project), for October 2019 entry, see individual links for each project.

## Further opportunities

We would be very happy to get enquiries, on these or related projects, from students with their own funding or who are applying to independent funding from foundations or governments.

There's related scope for bioinformatics/computational projects relating to gene expression and translation regulation in fungi, and methods devlopment, possibly working with our [collaborators](/links). Now there are [1000 sequenced fungal genomes](https://genome.jgi.doe.gov/programs/fungi/1000fungalgenomes.jsf) that need analyzing, so plenty of biology to discover!

## More context on PhD applications and the UK system
