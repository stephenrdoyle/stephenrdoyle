# The Wallace Lab main website

This repository encodes the [lab website](https://ewallace.github.io/) with github pages / jekyll.

##


### TODOS

- See links (funders/collaborators) from home page, not just "About"
- Add funder logos on main page
- Make protocols point to the github protocols repository

Also see Issues on [the github page](https://github.com/ewallace/ewallace.github.io).

## How to add content

1. Fork the repository to your own github account using the "fork" button on [the site](https://github.com/ewallace/ewallace.github.io). If you previously created a fork, be sure to synchronize your fork with the main repository first. Instructions at  [How To Ensure Your GitHub Fork Is Up To Date](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/git-github/github-collaboration/update-github-repositories-with-changes-by-others/) explain how to do that from the command line or the github website.
2. Clone your fork to your local computer (`git clone`)
3. Create a new feature branch (`git branch feature-name`) and check it out (`git checkout feature-name`)
4. Make your edits in a new feature branch, for example
  - add image files, for example add a profile picture at `assets/images/team/vladimir-sanchez-2019-pic.jpg`
  - edit an existing page, for example change the image location in `team/_posts/2019-01-01-vladimir-sanchez.md'
  - create a new page, for example copy `news/_posts/2018-10-01-welcome-sam.md` to a new file `news/_posts/2019-01-01-welcome-vlad.md` and then edit.
5. Commit your changes
  - first add them, e.g. `git add assets/images/team/vladimir-sanchez-2019-pic.jpg`
  - commit with an informative message, e.g. `git commit -m "new vladimir sanchez picture"`
6. If possible, preview the website locally using `bundle exec jekyll serve` to create it, and then browse to [http://127.0.0.1:4000/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/)
  - [install jekyll first](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
  - fix any errors or broken links and commit fixes.
7. Push changes to your fork with `git push feature-name`.
8. Make a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) into the *staging* branch. Someone, probably Edward, will review the pull request and incorporate it into the website.

Most of these steps can also be done via the website of your github fork, avoiding the command-line clone and push steps. I don't know how to preview the website edits this way, though.

### News
