We have posted two new bioRxiv preprints about the Ssd1 RNA-binding protein.

[One covers Ssd1 evolution](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.30.229070v1).

[The second addresses Ssd1 structure and function](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.22.350314v1).

These both come out of a great collaboration with [Atlanta Cook](http://cook.bio.ed.ac.uk/), also with [Liz Ballou](https://balloulab.org/) on evolution and conservation, and [David Tollervey and Stefan Bresson](https://tollervey.bio.ed.ac.uk/) on structure and function.
