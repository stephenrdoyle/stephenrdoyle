Welcome new lab manager / post-doctoral research associate [Dr. Rosey Bayne](/team/rosey-bayne)!

Rosey is an unusual polymath of a scientist, with decades of lab experience with diverse organisms, dozens of papers, and a MSc. from Edinburgh Napier University's School of Computing. We're very excited to have her on the team!
