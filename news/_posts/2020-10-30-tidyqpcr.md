We're working on an open-source R package for qPCR analysis, built on tools from the tidyverse. Check out our *fully documented* code on [tidyqpcr github ](https://github.com/ewallace/tidyqpcr).

Please try it, and get in touch with questions - we're doing user interviews to find out what features people need, so you can [volunteer for that too](https://github.com/ewallace/tidyqpcr/issues/65).
