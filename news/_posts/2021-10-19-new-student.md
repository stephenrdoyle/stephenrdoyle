Very excited to be invited to join Cinzia Cantacessi in advising new PhD candidate [Marina Papaiakovou]. Marina will be investigating the interaction between the microbiome and soil-transmitted helminth infections on treatment and disease outcomes. Starting off with a wealth of knowledge and experience in STH diagnostics with DeWorm3 and access to some amazing sample collections, it is going to be an exciting PhD!
