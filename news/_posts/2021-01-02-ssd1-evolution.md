Happy New Year! [Our paper on evolution of the Ssd1 RNA-binding protein has been accepted!](/papers/paper/ssd1-pseudonuclease-evolution)

This paper describes a change in protein function over evolutionary time: 
we show that ancestors of yeast Ssd1 were RNases related to Dis3L2, 
and that the nuclease activity has been lost repeatedly during fungal evolution.
