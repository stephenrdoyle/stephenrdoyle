Very happy to be invited to give a talk at the upcoming Anti-helmintics: Drugs, Resistance & Vaccines V meeting at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, on March 1-3, 2022. 

Will have to remember how to pack a bag, its been a while!

Check out the [conference website] - should be a good one, and I looking forward to catching up with old colleagues and meeting some 
new ones.
