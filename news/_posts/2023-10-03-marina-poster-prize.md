Congratulations to Marina on winning a [poster prize] at the Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Cambridge! 

Her poster "Geographic-specific variation in diagnostic targets of soil-transmitted helminths" presents part of an ongoing large-scale analysis to compare the genetic diversity of parasites sampled from faecesfrom around the world, and determine if this variation will impact molecular diagnostic tools used to detect them. Keep an eye out for a paper in the new year!
